      <h2>Ch11: Further Functions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a
          function to an object that is provided as the first argument.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the
          call() method to invoke the sayHello() function, providing each object
          as an argument. This will then take the value of this in the function:
          <code>
            <pre>
const clark = { name: 'Clark' };
const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };

sayHello.call(clark);
<< 'Hello, my name is Clark'

sayHello.call(bruce);
<< 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
            </pre>
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to
          be provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the
          value of this.
          <code>
            <pre>
function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){
    return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;
}

sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');
<< 'How do you do, my name is Clark'

sayHello.call(bruce);
<< 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memoization: </strong>If a function takes some time to compute
          a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. Then if
          the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from
          the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.
          <code>
            <pre>
function square(x){
    square.cache = square.cache || {};
    if (!square.cache[x]) {
        square.cache[x] = x*x;
    }
    return square.cache[x]
}

//Then we can see...

square(3);
<< 9

square(-11);
<< 121

square.cache;
<< {"3": 9, "-11": 121}
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions: </strong>IIFEs are a
          useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up
          within the scope of the function. This means the global namespace is
          not polluted with lots of variable names.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary Variables: </strong>There is no way to remove a
          variable from a scope once it is been declared. If a variable is only
          required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it is still available
          later in the code. Placing any code that uses the temporary variable
          inside an IIFE will ensure it is only available while the IIFE is
          invoked, then it will disappear.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Initialization Code: </strong>An IIFE can be used to set up
          any initialization code that there will be no need for again. Because
          the code is only run once, there is no need to create any reusable,
          named functions, and all the variables will also be temporary. An IIFE
          will be invoked once, and can set up any variables, objects and event
          handlers when the page loads.
          <code>
            <pre>
(function() {
    const name = 'Peter Parker'; // This might be obtained from a cookie in reality
    const days = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday', 'Friday','Saturday'];
    const date = new Date(),today = days[date.getDay()];
    console.log(`Welcome back ${name}. Today is ${today}`);

})();
<< 'Welcome back Peter Parker. Today is Tuesday'
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safe Use of Strict Mode: </strong>The recommended way to use
          strict mode is to place all your code inside an IIFE, like so:
          <code>
            <pre>
(function() {
    'use strict';

// All your code would go inside this function

})();
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creating Self-contained Code Blocks: </strong>
          <code>
            <pre>
(function() {
    // block A
    const name = 'Block A';
    console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
    }());

    (function() {
    // block B
    const name = 'Block B';
    console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
}());

<<  Hello from Block A
    Hello from Block B
        </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not
          only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is
          done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the
          same name as the function. <br />
          If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable
          will maintain the original function definition and not be rewritten.
          This is because the original function is assigned to a variable, then
          within the function, a variable with the same name as the function is
          assigned to a different function. EXAMPLE:
          <code>
            <pre>
function party(){
    console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
    party = function(){
        console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
    }
}

const beachParty = party; // note that the party function has not been invoked

beachParty(); // the party() function has now been redefined, even though it hasn't been called explicitly
<< 'Wow this is amazing!'

party(); 
<< 'Been there, got the T-Shirt'

beachParty(); // but this function hasn't been redefined
<< 'Wow this is amazing!'

beachParty(); // no matter how many times this is called it will remain the same
<< 'Wow this is amazing!'
          </pre
            >
          </code>
          This is called the Lazy Definition Pattern and is often used when some
          initialization code is required the first time it’s invoked. This
          means the initialization can be done the first time it’s called, then
          the function can be redefined to what you want it to be for every
          subsequent invocation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Init-Time Branching: </strong> This enables the functions to
          work more effectively in the browser, and avoid checking for features
          every time they’re invoked.
          <code>
            <pre>
function ride(){
    if (window.unicorn) { 
        ride = function(){
        // some code that uses the brand new and sparkly unicorn methods
        return 'Riding on a unicorn is the best!';
        }
    } else {
        ride = function(){
        // some code that uses the older pony methods
        return 'Riding on a pony is still pretty good';
        }
    }
    return ride();
}
            </pre>
          </code>
        </li>

      <h2>Ch13: AJAX</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of
          the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small
          fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asynchronous: </strong>When a request for data is sent, the
          program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. It can carry
          on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received.
          By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able to run in an
          efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JavaScript: </strong>JavaScript was always considered a
          'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax
          enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a
          server, allowing content to be updated in real time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>XML: </strong>When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML
          documents were often used to return data. Many different types of data
          can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is
          JSON, which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML.
          (Although it has never really taken off, the term Ajaj is sometimes
          used to describe the technique.) JSON also has the advantage of being
          natively supported in JavaScript, so you can deal with JavaScript
          objects rather than having to parse XML files using DOM methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>fetch():</code> method returns a promise that resolves to
          the response returned from the URL that was provided as an argument.
          <code>
            <pre>
fetch('https://example.com/data')
  .then( // code that handles the response )
  .catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>redirect()</code> method can be used to redirect to another
          URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the
          redirected URL.
          <code>
            <pre>
fetch(url)
  .then( response => response.redirect(newURL)); // redirects to another URL
  .then( // do something else )
  .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
        </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>text()</code> method takes a stream of text from the
          response, reads it to completion and then returns a promise that
          resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in
          JavaScript.
          <code>
            <pre>
fetch(url)
  .then( response => response.text() ); // transforms the text stream into a JavaScript string
  .then( text => console.log(text) )
  .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>blob()</code> method is used to read a file of raw data,
          such as an image or a spreadsheet. Once it has read the whole file, it
          returns a promise that resolves with a blob object.
          <code>
            <pre>
fetch(url)
  .then( response => response.blob() ); // transforms the data into a blob object
  .then( blob => console.log(blob.type) )
  .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>json()</code> method is used to deal with these by
          transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a
          JavaScript object.
          <code><pre>
fetch(url)
  .then( response => response.json() ); // transforms the JSON data into a JavaScript object
  .then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) )
  .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
          </pre></code>
        </li>
      </ul>
