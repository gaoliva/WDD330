      <h2>Ch9: The Window Object</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of
          properties and methods that contain information about the browser and
          computer screen.
          <strong>
            In a browser environment, the global object is the window object.
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The BOM only makes sense in a browser environment. This means that
            other environments (such as Node.js) probably won’t have a window
            object, although they will still have a global object; for example,
            Node.js has an object called global.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer
            to it using the keyword this in the global scope. The following code
            provides a quick way of assigning the variable global to the global
            object:
            <code>
              <pre>
// from within the global scope
const global = this;
          </pre
              >
            </code>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Dialogs: </strong>
          <p>
            The <code> window.alert() </code> method will pause the execution of
            the program and display a message in a dialog box. <br />
            <img src="./images/ch9alert.png" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code> window.confirm() </code> method will stop the execution
            of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the
            message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or
            Cancel. <br />
            <img src="./images/ch9confirm.png" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code> window.prompt() </code> method will stop the execution of
            the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as
            an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter
            text.
            <br />
            <img src="./images/ch9prompt.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            WARNING: These methods will stop the execution of a program in its
            tracks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Locations:</strong>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The <code>window.location</code> property is an object that
              contains information about the URL of the current page. It
              contains a number of properties that provide information about
              different fragments of the URL.
            </li>

            <li>
              The <code>protocol</code> property returns a string describing the
              protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that
              there is a colon (:) at the end.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <code>host</code> property returns a string describing the
              domain of the current URL and the port number (this is often
              omitted if the default port 80 is used).
            </li>
            <li>
              The <code>pathname</code> property returns a string of the path
              that follows the domain
            </li>
            <li>
              The <code>search</code> property returns a string that starts with
              a “?” followed by the query string parameters. It returns an empty
              string if there are no query string parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <code>hash</code> property returns a string that starts with a
              “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an empty
              string if there is no fragment identifier.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <code>origin</code> property returns a string that shows the
              protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This
              property is read-only, so cannot be changed
            </li>
            <li>
              The window.location object also has the following methods:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <code>reload()</code> method can be used to force a reload
                  of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, it
                  will force the browser to reload the page from the server,
                  instead of using a cached page.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The <code>assign()</code> method can be used to load another
                  resource from a URL provided as a parameter.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The <code>replace()</code> method is almost the same as the
                  assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in
                  the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate
                  back to it using the back button.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The <code>toString()</code> method returns a string containing
                  the whole URL.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
