      <h2>MDN: Validating forms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to
          see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints
          set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called
          client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called
          server-side validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reasons to validate data:
          <ul>
            <li>
              We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our
              applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in
              the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
            </li>
            <li>
              We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter
              secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account
              information.
            </li>
            <li>
              We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious
              users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Different types client-side validation:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation
              is completely customizable, but you need to create it all.
