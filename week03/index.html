      <h2>Object Methods: this</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a start, lets teach the user to say hello:
          <code>
            <pre>
let user = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30
  };
  
  user.sayHi = function() {
    alert("Hello!");
  };
  
  user.sayHi(); // Hello!
  </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Method shorthand we can omit "function" and just write sayHi().:
          <code>
            <pre>
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
                </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming
          languages. It can be used in any function, even if its not a method of
          an object:
          <code>
            <pre>
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
              </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Summary: </strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Functions that are stored in object properties are called
              “methods”.
            </li>
            <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
            <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
            <li>The value of this is defined at run-time.</li>

            <li>
              When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no
              value until the function is called.
            </li>
            <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
            <li>
              When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(),
              the value of this during the call is object.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When
              this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from
              outside.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ch5: Objects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An object literal is an object that is created directly in the
          language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces
          {}.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a property’s name doesn’t follow the rules for naming variables
          described in Chapter 2, it needs to be quoted. The property 'real
          name' in the example above needs to be quoted because it contains a
          space. In a real-world app, it's likely the "real name" property would
          actually be named real_name or realName.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation or
          using bracket notation. <br />
          <code>
            <pre>
superman.name
<< 'Superman'

superman['name']
<< 'Superman'
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation.
          <br />
          <code>
            <pre>
superman.fly()
<< 'Up, up and away!'

superman['fly']()
<< 'Up, up and away!'
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          You can check if properties or methods exist by using the "in"
          operator. you could also check to see if the property or method
          doesn’t return undefined. Another way is to use hasOwnProperty().
          <br />
          <code>
            <pre>
'city' in superman;
<< false

superman.city !== undefined;
<< false

superman.hasOwnProperty('city');
<< false

superman.hasOwnProperty('name');
<< true
          </pre
            >
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also find all the properties of an Object by using the following techniques:
          <br />
          <code>
            <pre>
↓↓↓↓ for in loop ↓↓↓↓
for(const key in superman) {
    console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]);
}
<< "name: Superman"
<< "real name: Clark Kent"
<< "height: 75"
<< "weight: 235"
<< "hero: true"
<< "villain: false"
<< "allies: Batman,Supergirl,Superboy"
<< "fly: function (){
    console.log(\"Up, up and away!\");
}"

↓↓↓↓ hasOwnProperty() ↓↓↓↓
for(const key in superman) {
  if(superman.hasOwnProperty(key)){
      console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]);
  }
}

↓↓↓↓ Object.keys() ↓↓↓↓
for(const key of Object.keys(superman)) {
  console.log(key);
}
<<  name
  real name
  height
  weight
  hero
  villain
  allies
  fly

↓↓↓↓ Object.values() ↓↓↓↓
for(const value of Object.values(superman)) {
    console.log(value);
}
<<  Superman
    Clark Kent
    75
    235
    true
    false
    [ 'Batman','Supergirl','Superboy' ]
    [Function: fly]

↓↓↓↓ Object.entries() ↓↓↓↓
for(const [key,value] of Object.entries(superman)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
<<  name: Superman
    real name: Clark Kent
    height: 75
    weight: 235
    hero: true
    villain: false
    allies: [ 'Batman','Supergirl','Superboy' ]
    fly: [Function: fly]

      <h3>Question(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No questions this week, as I was able to solve using some code pens that I found during the week.
